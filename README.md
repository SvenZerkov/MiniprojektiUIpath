# MiniprojektiUIpath

This is a simple automation process for a made up company.

The objective is to automate the company file backup process.

- There is a batch file for the initial directory tree.

- The initial files for projects are collected from random school projects.

The backup file needs to be done only from .bat ending files in all the project folders. UiPath goes through the project folders and if found, copies the .bat file to "Varmuuskopio" folder
